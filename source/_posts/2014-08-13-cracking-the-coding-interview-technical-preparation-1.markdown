###1. How to Practice a Question
1. Try to solve the problem on your own.
2. Write the code for the algorithm on paper.
3. Test your code - on paper.
4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer.

###2. What You need to Know

Data Structures | Algorithms | Concepts
--------------- | ---------- | --------
Linked List		 | Breadth First Search | BitManipulation
Binary Trees	| Depth First Search	| Singleton Design Pattern
Tries			| Binary Search			| Factory Design Pattern
Stacks			| Merge Sort			| Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
Queues			| Quick Sourt			| Recursion
Vectors / ArrayList | Tree Insert / Find / e.t.c | Big-O Time
HashTables		|						

In Praticular, hash tables are an extremely important topic. You will find that you use them frequently in solving interview questions.

###3. Five Steps to a Technical Question
1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.
2. Design an Algorithm.
3. Write pseudocode first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you'll eventually write "real" code.
4. Write your code at a moderate pace.
5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes.

The more problems you practice, the esier it will be to identify which approach to use!!!

####1. Ask Questions,
Good Questions might be ones like: what are the data types? How much data is there? What assumptions do you need to solve the problem? Who is the user?

####2. Design an Algorithm
Keep in mind:
1. What are its space and time complexity?
2. What happens if there is a lot of data?
3. Does your design cause other issues? For example, if you're creating a modified version of a binary search tree, did your design impact the time for insert, find, or delete?
4. If there are other issues or limitations, did you make the right trade-offs? For which scenarios might the trade-off be less optimal?
5. If they gave your specific data.

####3. Pseudocode

####4. Code

1. Use Data Structures Generously.
2. Don't Crowd Your Coding.

####5. Test

1. Extreme cases:0, negative, null, maximums, minimums.
2. User error: what happens if the user passes in null or a negative value?
3. General cases: Test the normal case.

###4.Five approaches

1. Examplify
2. Pattern Matching
3. Simplify and Generalize
4. Base Case and Build
5. Data Structure Brainstorm

###5. What Good Coding Looks Like

1. Correct.
2. Efficient.
3. Simple.
4. Readable.
5. Maintainable.
